			<p>This is a demo project, fulfilling the following criteria</p>
			<ul>
				<li>As a user I can order a specific fruit and to tell the system how much pieces I want.</li>
				<li>As a user I can add as many orders as I want.</li>
				<li>As a user I can remove one or more pieces of a single fruit from the order list.</li>
				<li>As a user I can get my order list containing all added pieces. <i>For each ordered fruit one line in the console with the name of the fruit and the quantity I have ordered. Not ordered fruits are not in the order list. Only one line per fruit â€“ not one line per order!</i></li>
